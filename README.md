# ROOT Data Frame Tutorial
This tutorial illustrate the usage of [ROOT::RDataFrame](https://root.cern/doc/master/classROOT_1_1RDataFrame.html) in C++ and Python. The notebooks guide through an examplary analysis producing a dimuon spectrum from CMS Open Data.

Stage 0 of the tutorial introduces you to the C++ API of ROOT's dataframe. Stage 1 reimplements the analysis in Python and introduces you to features of ROOT, which allow you to inject performant C++ code in your Python workflow. Finally, stage 2 shows how you can optimize your analysis in Python even further by injecting precompiled C++ code in your application with very little effort ensuring best performance combined with the convenience of Python.
